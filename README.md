# TNG eWallet Phishing Example

It has come to my attention (credits to ThatSkyKid) that some idiotic scammer has decided to upload their entire phishing website source code onto GitHub, complete with a Telegram bot token. I have reported the account to GitHub support at the time this is written.

This is originally forked from bantuanewallett/rm1000 (with two trailing 't's, very sneaky), GitHub Pages is directly used on the original repo to scam people through https://bantuanewallett.github.io/rm1000/. I've decided to fork it to provide a publicly accessible peek into how a Malaysian phishing site might work internally.

For obvious reasons, this is for educational purpose only. Do NOT use this codebase to do any evil.
